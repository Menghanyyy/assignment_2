## README:

### Compile and Run

This repository contains the source code for <strong>Vent</strong>, an application developed under android platform.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you'll need to set up your development environment. Make sure you have the following installed:

- Android Studio (version 2020.3.1 or higher recommended)
- Android SDK (API level 30 or higher recommended)
- An Android Virtual Device (AVD) or a physical Android device (<Strong> Recommended Virtual Device: Pixel 3a XL (API 30)</Strong>)

Note that the backend will be hosted until December 2023, so does not need to be self-hosted when testing the application until now.

### Getting Started

Open the Project:

1. Launch Android Studio.
2. Select 'Open an Existing Project'.
3. Navigate to the place where the project folder is stored and select the project directory.

At the first time build, the Android studio will need to sync with the build of the project. Therefore, please click 'Sync Now' on the bar that appears on top of the code editor.
The sync process may take a while, likely 1-3 minutes depending on the computer's performance.

Run the Application:

<strong>Virtual Device</strong>
  
1. Select a virtual device that you want to run in the top right of the toolbar.
2. Press the "Run" button ("Play" icon) to run the application.

<strong>Physical Device</strong>
   
1. Connect your Android device and computer to a similar wireless network.
2. Enable Developer Options on your Android device by going to Settings > Search "Developer Options" > Developer Options > Turn On. 
3. Enable Wireless Debugging Options on your Android device by going to Settings > Search "Wireless Debugging" > Wireless Debugging > Turn On. (Access permission may needed, please click "Allow")
4. Open the virtual device dropdown menu at the top right of the toolbar in Android Studio, and select Device Manager.
5. In the device manager select "Physical" and click "Pair using Wifi".
6. Ensure that your Android Device's Wireless Debugging is turned on. Then select "Pair device with QR code".
7. Scan the QR code that shows on the Device Manager with your physical device. A Green Tick should show on your computer once it pairs successfully. (This may take 2 minutes depending on your device's and network performance)
8. Android Studio will recognize the device. You can see the connected device in the dropdown menu at the top right of the toolbar.
9. Select your device from the target dropdown menu in the toolbar.
10. Press the "Run" button (the "Play" icon) in the toolbar of Android Studio to build and run the application on your connected device.
11. The app should now be built and run on your physical device. You'll see the app launching after the build process is completed.


### Testing

To test attending an event on a map, the code below can be used for an event that has already been created. Simply click 'join new event' and paste in the code to explore that event and its activities (Otherwise, you can create your own event and join this to explore):
